Recordings of guitar notes used for testing. Each file contains
digital audio of a single note on the guitar, the note being named
in the filename. File format is exactly 4 seconds of raw (headerless), 
uncompressed, mono, 11025 Hz sample rate, signed 16-bit PCM audio.

TODO
- bring in some explanations from note-limits.txt of the set of
data being tested on?
- redo with a different sample rate if use a lower sample rate for
the actual tuner?
- explain why the sample rates / bit width are why they are (bit width
becuase of the ADC 12-bit of the Pico?)
