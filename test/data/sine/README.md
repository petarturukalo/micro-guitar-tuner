The subdirectories here contain sine waves (produced with GNU Radio) 
used for testing. The directory names what the sine waves in it are 
used to test. Each file contains data for a sine wave of some frequency, 
that frequency in Hz being named in its filename. File format is the same as 
the note recordings described in `../note/README.md`, except these 
are only 1 frame long instead of 4.
