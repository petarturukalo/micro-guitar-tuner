Sine waves used for testing. Each file contains data for a
sine wave of some frequency, that frequency in Hz being named 
in its filename. File format is the same as the note recordings 
as described in ../note/README.md, except these are only 1 second 
long instead of 4.

TODO
- use readme fmt to inline ../note/README.md
